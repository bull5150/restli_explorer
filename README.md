Trying out the rest.li services

I built this repo with VS Code and the  Gradle Language Support Extension.  This was built off of the rest.li walk through tutorial located https://github.com/linkedin/rest.li/wiki/Quickstart:-A-Tutorial-Introduction-to-Rest.li#creating-a-client

You will need:

-Gradle
-Java
-VS Code is preferred or and IDE of your choosing
